Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language and major emphasis has been placed on making sure that your existing codebase can interact properly with Kotlin. You can easily call Kotlin code from Java and Java code from Kotlin. This makes adoption much easier and lower-risk.

Does Kotlin use Maven or Gradle?
Visit https://start.spring.io and choose the Kotlin language. Gradle is the most commonly used build tool in Kotlin, and it provides a Kotlin DSL which is used by default when generating a Kotlin project, so this is the recommended choice. But you can also use Maven if you are more comfortable with it.
